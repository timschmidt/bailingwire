 * Parallax Propeller
 * 
 * 8 cores
 * 2 timers per core
 * 2 video registers per core
 * 2Kb SRAM per core
 * 32Kb RAM, 32Kb ROM accessible to all cores, round-robin
 * ROM contains bitmap font, base 2 2048 entry log table, base 2 2048 entry antilog table, sine table (16-bit, 2049 entries representing first quadrant, angles from 0 to Ï€/2; other three quadrants are created from the same table).
 * From Wikipedia: "The math extensions are intended to help compensate for the lack of a floating-point unit as well as more primitive missing operations, such as multiplication and division (this is masked in Spin but is a limitation for assembly language routines). The Propeller is a 32-bit processor, however, and these tables may not have sufficient accuracy for higher-precision applications."
 * no interrupts - spin up a core, and ask it to poll a pin state
 * no ADC, I2C, Serial, SPI, etc. - spin up a core and bit-bang the protocol.  Mmmmm.  Hardwareish.
 * 32 programmable i/o lines accessible to all cores
