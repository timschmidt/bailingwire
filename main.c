// Accelleration in Marlin is accomplished by scaling the interrupt timer shared by all axes, uniformly scaling the pre-computed stepping ratios.  How to accomplish per-axis accelleration curves without incurring a per-tick re-evaluation of each axis's acceleration curve function?

// use promises to evaluate dynamic ladder-logic style constraints?  Better models?
// command / function list:
//  - call a per-coordinate system auto probing for axis _

#include <stdlib.h>
#include "devices.h"

void error( int error_number )
{
	// look up error text in core-constants, and output to serial, LCD
	// per-device error handling? - not initially
}

int setup(void) {
	char* buffer;
	buffer = (char*)calloc(4, 32); // buffer 4x 32byte commands
	char* current_command = buffer;
	
	init_device_list();
	
	uart_init();  // from driver-avrserial.h
	stdout = &uart_output;

    char input;
