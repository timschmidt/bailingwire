// Accelleration in Marlin is accomplished by scaling the interrupt timer shared by all axes, uniformly scaling the pre-computed stepping ratios.  How to accomplish per-axis accelleration curves without incurring a per-tick re-evaluation of each axis's acceleration curve function?

// use promises to evaluate dynamic ladder-logic style constraints?  Better models?
// command list:
//  - call a per-coordinate system auto probing for axis _ (how are endstops / sensors specified?)
//  -
