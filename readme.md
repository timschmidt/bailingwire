# Bailingwire Device Control Firmware

Bailingwire uses a powerful hardware abstraction model to provide per-axis runtime reconfigurable geometry, feedback, and control algorithms for a wide variety of actuators, sensors, and other hardware.

## Goals
 - near 100% runtime reconfigurability
 - support hot pluggable hardware
 - per-axis configurable geometry (cartesian, delta, polar, etc.)
 - support for boards with standardized connectors like GROVE
 - first-class support for closed-loop servo and/or stepper control
 - no hard-coded policy (movement rules, overheat protection, etc.), but support for dynamically constructing it
 - fits in 2kb ram
 - fits in 32kb flash

## Structure
### Core
 - Configured at compile time
 - Microcontroller-specific
 - Board-specific
 - Hardware-agnostic high-level device interfaces
 - transparent unit conversion

### Driver
 - a struct containing data and pointers to one or more functions.
 - when the struct is allocated in memory, initialized, and a pointer to it is added to the driver list, it's loaded.
 - first byte is a DEVICE_TYPE identifier
 - second byte is a function pointer to an initialization function
 - followed by device class specific interface function pointers and data at defined offsets
 - followed by driver specific data and function pointers at undefined offsets
 - each driver provides one, and consumes one or more of these pre-defined function pointer interfaces
 - device function cascades from the most abstract device interfaces to the most hardware-specific.
 - standard interfaces defined for GPIO, serial, PWM, ADC, I2C, 1Wire, EEPROM, various I/O expansion ICs, networking ICs, motor control ICs, motors, pumps, solenoids, lights, heaters, fans, servos, sensors (flow, conductivity, ph, light, humidity, temperature, accellerometers, etc.)
 - configurable at run time

### Feedback
 - comsumed by the i/o interrupt handler
 - i/o interrupt handler runs when a hardware interrupt happens (a pin changes state, or serial packet is recieved, etc.)
 - the i/o interrupt handler passes calls the 'state-change' function pointed to by the feedback struct
 - the state-change function performs a driver-specific calculation and updates/returns? the associated axis' position

### Control
 - algorithms for determining when a machine should act based on sensor input
 - regulate air/fluid flow, temperature, concentrations in fluids, light intensity, voltage, etc.
 - configurable per-axis, at runtime

### Coordinates
 - provide function pointers with compatible interfaces to convert from cartesian coordinates (used in the core kinematic models) and per-axis native coordinates in real, automatically converted to per-axis native units

### Service
 - runs in the idle loop


##Todo:
 - improve code readability by defining macros, or similar for standard function call interfaces functions, core functions.
 - build 8 / 32bit compatibility layer for Propeller
 - build propeller cog -> interrupt handler interface in core-interrupt.h
 - write constant storage / retrieval functions
 - pull in code for all GROVE hardware - audit licenses
 - implement fast sqrt approximation from teacup firmware


Serial Communications Protocol Notes:
 
Packet-based, binary, one device 'command' per packet.  Each packet is prefixed by a XX byte device ID, and each packet's payload is 0 to 32 bytes long.  All packets, reguardless of address prefix, are sent to the same serial connection from the HOST.  The DEVICE on the recieving side of that serial connection will route the packets apropriately.

Packet / Command IDs for serial-retry - incremental, random, length, location?
  
Checksums - see nRF datasheet
